    "description": "[The hi:project](http://hi-project.org/) exists to replace UI (user interface) with HI ([human interface](http://hi-project.org/faqs/what-do-you-mean-by-human-interface/)). Endorsed by the [Web Science Trust](http://webscience.org/wst-board-of-trustees/), the project recognizes that [decentralization cannot be marketed](http://hi-project.org/2015/10/decentralization-cannot-be-marketed/). Rather, the team has identified the technical, social and commercial levers required to seed HI with everyone with an Internet connection through the organizations that already feature in their lives. Organizations are attracted to early competitive differentiation by improving usability and accessibility, and by empowering customers to have domain over their personal data. This in turn aids legal and ethical compliance in privacy terms. HI also disintermediates the dominant OS vendors to the organization's commercial benefit. Decentralization at the interface layer is then a consequence. The project is open and non-profit."
